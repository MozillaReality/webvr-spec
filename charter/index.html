      Goals
    </h2>
    <p>
      The Goal of the W3C WebVR Community Group is to help bring
      high-performance Virtual Reality (VR) to the open Web. Currently, access
      to VR devices is limited to specific native platforms. For example,
      Oculus Rift supports Windows and HTC Vive supports SteamVR platform only.
      With WebVR specs, VR experiences could be available on the Web across
      platforms.
    </p>
    <h2 id="scope-of-work">
      Scope of Work
    </h2>
    <h3>
      WebVR API
    </h3>
    <p>
      One initial specification the group will work on is the WebVR API that
      defines an API for accessing VR devices, including sensors and
      head-mounted displays on the Web. On 2016-03-30, experimental
      implementations are available in the Firefox Nightly release channel
      and in experimental builds of Chromium Browser.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hardware that enables VR applications requires high-precision,
      low-latency interfaces to deliver an acceptable experience. Other
      interfaces, such as device orientation events, can be repurposed to
      surface VR input but doing so dilutes the interface’s original intent and
      often does not provide the precision necessary for high-quality VR. The
      WebVR API provides purpose-built interfaces to VR hardware to allow
      developers to build compelling, comfortable VR experiences.
    </p>

    <h3>
      Hand Position API
    </h3>

    <p>
      Information about a user’s hand positions in 3 dimensional space
      would be useful in VR and in other uses.  This would be like commonly
      used pointer events, but for the positions of points on the
      hands in a 3D frame of reference.  For instance, the hand could be described
      in 3D space by points at the fingertip and 3 joints of each finger and
      1 point at the base of the palm and 1 on the wrist.  The origin of the
      space could be a point of view in the device (e.g. from the headset
      or from a sensor on another type of device.).
    </p>

    <p>
      This API is independent of how hand position is determined.  The VR system
      could use a 3D camera or motion detection technologies on the hand, or
      any other method.  Methods for determining hand position are out of
      scope for this group.  In scope is providing hand and finger positions
      in space from a reference position.
    </p>

    <p>
      A related API would draw a wireframe hand in the VR display based on the
      hand position data, so the Web page would not have to receive and draw it.
      This could be more performant than the page receiving data and drawing itself.
    </p>


    <h3>
      Web Security Model for all APIs
    </h3>

    <p>
      The APIs use the Web’s security model based on origins, and as such
      target products are web browsers. Specific security and privacy
      considerations constrain the scope of the specification to make the API
      implementable in Web browsers without compromising the user’s security or
      privacy. Specific security considerations for the WebVR API are
      enumerated in the specification.
    </p>
    <h3 id="out-of-scope">
      Out of Scope
    </h3>
    <p>
      The group will not define the underlying VR system that the Web APIs use.
      These APIs give access to capabilities already provided on systems. The
      group will not define media codecs.
    </p>
    <h2 id="deliverables">
      Deliverables

    <h3 id="specifications">
      Specifications
    </h3>
    <p>
      <a href="https://mozvr.github.io/webvr-spec/">WebVR API</a>: API for
      accessing VR devices from Web pages (Incubator Draft spec).
    </p>
    <p>
      Web Hand Position API: API to receive events describing the 3D position
      of both hands, with points providing information on each finger segment,
      the palm, and wrist.  This information could be used to draw the hands
      or interpretted to allow hands to provide information to the VR app.
      A related API could draw the hands in the display without fetching
      the data and drawing in the Web page.
    </p>
    <h3 id="non-normative-reports">
      Non-Normative Reports
    </h3>
    <p>
      The group may produce other Community Group Reports within the scope of
      this charter but that are not Specifications, for instance use cases,
      requirements, or white papers.

    <p class="remove">
      {TBD: State whether test suites or any other software will be created for
      any Specifications and list the relevant licenses. For information about
      contributions to W3C test suites, please see <a href=

    </p>
    <h2 id="process">
      Community and Business Group Process
    </h2>
    <p>
      The group operates under the <a href=
      "https://www.w3.org/community/about/agreements/">Community and Business
      Group Process</a>. Terms in this Charter that conflict with those of the
      Community and Business Group Process are void.
    </p>
    <p>
      As with other Community Groups, W3C seeks organizational licensing
      commitments under the <a href=
      'http://www.w3.org/community/about/agreements/cla/'>W3C Community
      Contributor License Agreement (CLA)</a>. When people request to
      participate without representing their organization's legal interests,
      W3C will in general approve those requests for this group with the
      following understanding: W3C will seek and expect an organizational
      commitment under the CLA starting with the individual's first request to
      make a contribution to a group <a href="#deliverables">Deliverable</a>.
      The section on <a href="#contrib">Contribution Mechanics</a> describes
      how W3C expects to monitor these contribution requests.
    </p>
    <h2 id="worklimit">
      Work Limited to Charter Scope
    </h2>
    <p>
      The group will not publish Specifications on topics other than those
      listed under <a href="#specifications">Specifications</a> above. See
      below for <a href="#charter-change">how to modify the charter</a>.
    </p>
    <h2 id="contrib">
      Contribution Mechanics
    </h2>
    <p>
      Substantive Contributions to Specifications can only be made by Community
      Group Participants who have agreed to the <a href=
      "http://www.w3.org/community/about/agreements/cla/">W3C Community
      Contributor License Agreement (CLA)</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Specifications created in the Community Group must use the <a href=
      "http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Legal/2015/copyright-software-and-document">
      W3C Software and Document License</a>. All other documents produced by
      the group should use that License where possible.
    </p>
    <p>
      Community Group participants agree to make all contributions in the
      GitHub repo the group is using for the particular document. This may be
      in the form of a pull request (preferred), by raising an issue, or by
      adding a comment to an existing issue.
    </p>
    <p>
      All Github repositories attached to the Community Group must contain a
      copy of the <a href=
      "https://github.com/w3c/licenses/blob/master/CG-CONTRIBUTING.md">CONTRIBUTING</a>
      and <a href=
      "https://github.com/w3c/licenses/blob/master/CG-LICENSE.md">LICENSE</a>
      files.
    </p>
    <p>
      Note: this Community Group will not use a contrib mailing list for
      contributions since all contributions will be tracked via Github
      mechanisms (e.g. pull requests). For the same reason, the Community Group
      mailing list must not be used for making or discussing substantive
      contributions to Specifications.
    </p>
    <h2 id="transparency">
      Transparency
    </h2>
    <p>
      The group will conduct all of its technical work in public. If the group
      uses GitHub, all technical work will occur in its GitHub repositories
      (and not in mailing list discussions). This is to ensure contributions
      can be tracked through a software tool.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meetings may be restricted to Community Group participants, but a public
      summary or minutes must be posted to the group's public mailing list, or
      to a GitHub issue if the group uses GitHub.
    </p>
    <h2 id="decision">
      Decision Process
    </h2>
    <p>
      This group will seek to make decisions where there is consensus. Groups
      are free to decide how to make decisions (e.g. Participants who have
      earned Committer status for a history of useful contributions assess
      consensus, or the Chair assesses consensus, or where consensus isn't
      clear there is a Call for Consensus [CfC] to allow multi-day online
      feedback for a proposed course of action). It is expected that
      participants can earn Committer status through a history of valuable
      contributions as is common in open source projects. After discussion and
      due consideration of different opinions, a decision should be publicly
      recorded (where GitHub is used as the resolution of an Issue).
    </p>
    <p>
      If substantial disagreement remains (e.g. the group is divided) and the
      group needs to decide an Issue in order to continue to make progress, the
      Committers will choose an alternative that had substantial support (with
      a vote of Committers if necessary). Individuals who disagree with the
      choice are strongly encouraged to take ownership of their objection by
      taking ownership of an alternative fork. This is explicitly allowed (and
      preferred to blocking progress) with a goal of letting implementation
      experience inform which spec is ultimately chosen by the group to move
      ahead with.
    </p>
    <p>
      Any decisions reached at any meeting are tentative and should be recorded
      in a GitHub Issue for groups that use GitHub and otherwise on the group's
      public mail list. Any group participant may object to a decision reached
      at an online or in-person meeting within 7 days of publication of the
      decision provided that they include clear technical reasons for their
      objection. The Chairs will facilitate discussion to try to resolve the
      objection according to the <a href="#decision">decision process</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is the Chairs' responsibility to ensure that the decision process is
      fair, respects the consensus of the CG, and does not unreasonably favour
      or discriminate against any group participant or their employer.
    </p>
    <h2 id="chairs">
      Chair Selection
    </h2>
    <p>
      Participants in this group choose their Chair(s) and can replace their
      Chair(s) at any time using whatever means they prefer. However, if 5
      participants, no two from the same organisation, call for an election,
      the group must use the following process to replace any current Chair(s)
      with a new Chair, consulting the Community Development Lead on election
      operations (e.g., voting infrastructure and using <a href=
      "https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2777">RFC 2777</a>).
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>Participants announce their candidacies. Participants have 14 days to
      announce their candidacies, but this period ends as soon as all
      participants have announced their intentions. If there is only one
      candidate, that person becomes the Chair. If there are two or more
      candidates, there is a vote. Otherwise, nothing changes.
      </li>
      <li>Participants vote. Participants have 21 days to vote for a single
      candidate, but this period ends as soon as all participants have voted.
      The individual who receives the most votes, no two from the same
      organisation, is elected chair. In case of a tie, RFC2777 is used to
      break the tie. An elected Chair may appoint co-Chairs.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      Participants dissatisfied with the outcome of an election may ask the
      Community Development Lead to intervene. The Community Development Lead,
      after evaluating the election, may take any action including no action.
    </p>
    <h2 id="charter-change">
      Amendments to this Charter
    </h2>
    <p>
      The group can decide to work on a proposed amended charter, editing the
      text using the <a href="#decision">Decision Process</a> described above.
      The decision on whether to adopt the amended charter is made by
      conducting a 30-day vote on the proposed new charter. The new charter, if
      approved, takes effect on either the proposed date in the charter itself,
      or 7 days after the result of the election is announced, whichever is
      later. A new charter must receive 2/3 of the votes cast in the approval
      vote to pass. The group may make simple corrections to the charter such
      as deliverable dates by the simpler group decision process rather than
      this charter amendment process. The group will use the amendment process
      for any substantive changes to the goals, scope, deliverables, decision
      process or rules for amending the charter.
